## Select Project
If you haven't created a project yet, you need to first configure one - see [this section in the installation guide](https://rjankovic.github.io/DLS/install_guide#create-project).
  
After you've configured your project, it will show up in the project list after launching the client. Alternatively, you can go to Project > Open to switch between projects.
