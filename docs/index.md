  Data Lineage Services (DLS) helps data analysts and developers navigate BI solutions. It 
   - automates dependency and impact analysis
   - helps you document your solution and create a business glossary
   - provides fulltext search

Currently, these technologies are supported:
  - SQL Server Databases
  - Analysis Services (Tabular and Multidimensional)
  - SQL Server Integration Services
  - SQL Server Reporting Services
  - Power BI (when connected to SSAS)

What you will need to run DLS:
 - Windows with current .NET Framework
 - a SQL Server instance to host the DLS database. This must support SQL Service Broker, so no Azure SQL DB. You can use the developer edition if needed
 - the account you use to connect to databases needs to have READ DEFINITION permissions
